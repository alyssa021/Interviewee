This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number ``k``,
return whether any two numbers from the list add up to ``k``.

For example, given ``[10, 15, 3, 7]`` and ``k`` of ``17``,
return true since ``10 + 7`` is ``17``.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

### Solutions
---
**Check** each pair and see if it is 17;

```cpp
A = [10, 15, 3, 7];
for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
  for(int j = i + 1; j < A.size(); j++){
    if(A[i] + A[j] == k){
      return true;
    }
  }
}

return false;
```

**If** array is sorted, that gives us a new way to solve the problem

Use two pointers and traverse in opposite direction
start from each opposite end.

Lets call them ``left`` and ``right`` pointers.

Initially, ``left`` would be pointing at the smallest number of the array and ``right`` would
be pointing at the greatest number of the array.

Check the sum of the numbers both pointers are pointing to,
if it is smaller than ``k`` then increment ``left`` pointer
else if it is greater than ``k`` then decrement ``right`` pointer
else you've got the `k`

Another solution in case the numbers are not sorted is to traverse the array and put the complement
of that element in a set and search for it at each encounter.

[unordered_set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unordered_associative_containers_(C%2B%2B)#Overview_of_functions)

Unordered sets are containers that store unique elements in no particular order, and which allow for fast retrieval of individual elements based on their value.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    int temp, N = 4;
    int k = 8;
    int arr[N] = {1, 2, 4, 3};
    unordered_set<int> complements;
    unordered_set<int>::iterator itr;

    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        itr = complements.find(arr[i]);
        if(itr != complements.end()){
            cout << "Yes" << endl;
            return 0;
        } else {
            complements.insert(k - arr[i]);
        }
    }

    cout << "No" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
