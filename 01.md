This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number ``k``,
return whether any two numbers from the list add up to ``k``.

For example, given ``[10, 15, 3, 7]`` and ``k`` of ``17``,
return true since ``10 + 7`` is ``17``.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

### Solutions
---
**Check** each pair and see if it is 17;

```cpp
A = [10, 15, 3, 7];
for(int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
  for(int j = i + 1; j < A.size(); j++){
    if(A[i] + A[j] == k){
      return true;
    }
  }
}

return false;
```

**If** array is sorted, that gives us a new way to solve the problem

Use two pointers and traverse in opposite direction
start from each opposite end.

Lets call them ``left`` and ``right`` pointers.

Initially, ``left`` would be pointing at the smallest number of the array and ``right`` would
be pointing at the greatest number of the array.

Check the sum of the numbers both pointers are pointing to,
if it is smaller than ``k`` then increment ``left`` pointer
else if it is greater than ``k`` then decrement ``right`` pointer
else you've got the `k`
