This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at 
index ``i`` of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original 
array except the one at ``i``.

For example, if our input was ``[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]``, the expected output would 
be ``[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]``. If our input was ``[3, 2, 1]``, the expected output 
would be ``[2, 3, 6]``.

### Solutions

---

We could find the total ``product`` and update the ``arr`` with ``product/arr[i]``

```cpp
int main(){
    int N = 5;
    int arr[N] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    long int product = 1;
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        product *= arr[i];
    }

    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        arr[i] = product / arr[i];
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }

    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Another solution that doesn't include division operation
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    int N = 5;
    int left = 1;
    int arr[N] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    result[N-1] = 1;

    for(int i = N - 2; i > -1; i--){
        result[i] = result[i + 1] * arr[i + 1];
    }
    
    // result = [120, 60, 20, 5, 1];
    for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
        result[i] *= left;
        left *= arr[i];
    }

    // result = [120, 60, 40, 30, 24];
    return 0;
}
```
